### Saitel Agudelo @daniagudelos

Hi there! 

I am an engineer in love with design patterns and good coding practices. 

## Projects:

:ballot_box_with_check: Check out my [master's thesis](https://github.com/daniagudelos/contact_tracing). It is about the effect of periodic contact patterns on the effiiency of contact tracing. What does it has to do with coding? Let me rephrase: It is an optimization problem solved with numerical algorithms written in python.

:mag_right: I worked on the [MEMAP project](https://github.com/SES-fortiss/SmartGridCoSimulation). We created a tool to optimize non-used energy potentials in a network of buildings, saving money and reducing Co2 emissions.

:computer: My website is up! I use this space to share a bit of who I am. The technical and non-technical parts of me. Check it out at [https://daniagudelos.github.io/](https://daniagudelos.github.io/)

:bulb: The idea is to make more posts about what I learn. It will take some time, so be patient. Bear with me. It will be fun.

## Always learning!

Currently:
- Gradle: plugins, tasks
- Kotlin
- Docker
- Debian Packages
- Painting
