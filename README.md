### Saitel Agudelo @daniagudelos

Hi there! 

I am an engineer in love with design patterns and good coding practices. 

## Projects:

:ballot_box_with_check: Check out my [master's thesis](https://github.com/daniagudelos/contact_tracing). It is about the effect of periodic contact patterns on the effiiency of contact tracing. What does it has to do with coding? Let me rephrase: It is an optimization problem solved with numerical algorithms written in python.

:mag_right: Currenty, I am working on the [MEMAP project](https://github.com/SES-fortiss/SmartGridCoSimulation). We created a tool to optimize non-used energy potentials in a network of buildings, saving money and reducing Co2 emissions. Soon V6 will be ready!

:bulb: I would like to share with you some of the projects I have made over the
last few years. It will take some time, so: patience. But, bear with me. It will
be fun. You will see content about:
- Vim
- Git
- Java

## Always learning!

Currently:
- Gradle: plugins, tasks
- Kotlin
- Docker
- Debian Packages
- Oil painting
